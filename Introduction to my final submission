My final submission includes some of the work I have completed over the course of the Academy and will show my progression. The final project is contained within the folder "PhotoSite". 
It will run using Visual Studio Code with Live Preview installed.

Although not part of this submission, there is another public repository called - Academy, which contains files I have worked on during the academy uploaded to Github via powershell.

Thank you

Steve
